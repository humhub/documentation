The **HumHub** default themes can be used out of the box to create clean and professional looking social networks.

You can customize main colors and add custom stylesheets in `Administration -> Settings -> Appearance`.

However, you may wish to provide more customizations that matches your personal design aesthetic or that of an existing enterprise design.

**HumHub** provides two different approaches to change the look and feel:

## Stylesheets (Sass)

Modify the default stylesheets using [Sass syntax](https://sass-lang.com/) (`.scss` files).

## Adjust View Files

Overwrite the default templates used in **HumHub** to modify elements, adjust positions, remove existing elements or also add new elements.
